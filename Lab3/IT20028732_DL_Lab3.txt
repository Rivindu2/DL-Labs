Cell 4 shows a 1D filter when that filter is applied to the signal we can see 2 peaks one at where the intensity goes from high to low (positive peak) and one that goes from low to high (negative peak) using that we can Identify edges by detecting the start and end of an edge using positive and negative edges.Q3When epochs increases the dataset will go on multiple passes through the algorithm the count of passes depend on the number of epochs and this causes the algorithm to over familiarize the training dataset (overfitting) and when it sees a new data like validation data it might perform poorely.One thing we can do to minimize this error is to have variations in training data via augmentation which will increase dataset and thus variety. The model will be trained for uncertainty in some degree.
